        This class is truly unique and special because we have thoughtfully
        designed it using a gamification model. By incorporating elements of
        game design, we aim to make the learning experience more enjoyable,
        interactive, and engaging for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make the experience even more exciting, we have introduced a reward
        system called the <b>ONE-Stamp</b>. This system is designed to
        encourage active participation and consistent effort. By attending
        classes and specific tasks like submitting assignments or homework,
        you can earn these ONE-stamps. Think of them as small tokens of
        recognition for your dedication, adding an layer of motivation
        to your learning journey in this course üéñÔ∏è.
